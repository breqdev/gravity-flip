# gravity-flip
A platformer game where you can flip gravity.  

Press any key to reverse your current gravity.

Earn points by colliding with the top/bottom of each platform.  
Lose points by colliding with the left/front side of each platform. You will lose half your points, plus one.  

The game is over when either you have lost all of your points or you have reached the pink stripe.  

I made this for an Engineering class assignment at school.
